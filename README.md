# Valentine Link (Static Site)

This is a simple, cute Valentine invite you can host for free on GitHub Pages.
It works by opening `index.html` locally and also when hosted.

## Customize the text
Open `script.js` and edit the constants at the top:

- `HER_NAME`
- `YOUR_NAME`
- `QUESTION_LINE`
- `SUBTITLE_LINE`
- `SUCCESS_LINE`
- `FOOTER_LINE`

## Replace images
Replace these placeholder files in `assets/`:

- `assets/celebrate.gif` (your confetti/hearts GIF)
- `assets/me.jpg` (optional photo)

## Run locally
Just double-click `index.html` to open in your browser.

## Host for free with GitHub Pages
1) Create a new GitHub repo (no README needed).
2) Upload all files from this folder to the repo root.
3) On GitHub, go to **Settings → Pages**.
4) Under **Build and deployment**, choose:
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main** and **/ (root)**
5) Click **Save**. After a minute, GitHub will show your public URL at the top.

Your link will look like:
`https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME/`

Share that link in your email/DM.
